<h1 align="center">REST API: Bazaar Sales Management</h1>
<h3>Context and Purpose of Development:</h3>
This Java Spring Boot REST application has been fully developed; however, it is crucial to emphasize that it does not provide a solution to an actual real-world necessity. Instead, it aligns with the requirements outlined in the final project assignment for the course. The application serves as a demonstration of practical skills in API development using Java with Spring Boot, adhering meticulously to the specified objectives and scenarios provided within the course curriculum.
<h3>Desciption:</h3>
It serves as a backend system for a bazaar, facilitating the management of products, clients, and sales. It provides endpoints for CRUD operations on products, clients, and sales, as well as additional functionalities such as retrieving low-stock products, fetching products from a specific sale, summarizing sales data for a specific day, and identifying the sale with the highest total amount. The system is designed to handle HTTP requests from both web and mobile clients.

## Technologies used:
<h4>Java</h4>
Java serves as the primary programming language for this project, providing robustness and platform independence for backend development.

<h4>Spring Boot</h4>
Spring Boot is utilized as the framework for building the RESTful API. It simplifies development with auto-configuration and embedded servers, enabling rapid development of production-ready applications.

<h4>Spring Data JPA</h4>
Spring Data JPA is used for data access and persistence. It simplifies data access layer implementation with repositories and query methods, facilitating interaction with the PostgreSQL database.

<h4>PostgreSQL Database</h4>
PostgreSQL is employed as the relational database management system for this project.

<h4>Postman</h4>
Postman is utilized for API testing and development. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests, testing endpoints, and validating API responses, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the API implementation.
